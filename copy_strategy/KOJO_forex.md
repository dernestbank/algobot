Notes on Kojo Forex’s Trading Strategies

Overview
    •	Kojo Forex (Kuu Forex, “King of Blues”) is a Ghanaian trader known for his technical analysis-focused trading approach.
    •	He emphasizes patience, precision, and simplicity in his trading plan.
    •	While fundamentals are briefly considered, Kojo’s main strategy revolves around top-down technical analysis.

Core Trading Strategies
    1.	Top-Down Analysis
    •	Starts on the monthly chart to understand the bigger picture and locate key institutional zones.
    •	Institutions trade on larger timeframes (monthly/weekly).
    •	Zones are spaced evenly by 500–1,000 pips depending on the asset.
    •	Emphasis on round numbers (e.g., 1.3500) because institutions avoid trading at random numbers.
    •	These monthly zones remain relevant for months, acting as long-term support/resistance levels.
    2.	Market Structure and Trend Lines
    •	Moves down to the daily or 8-hour chart to analyze market structure and trend direction.
    •	Uses trend lines to define the trend and forms a pennant or flag pattern:
    •	Draws one trend line above price and another below it.
    •	Kojo looks for false breakouts:
    •	Waits for a candle to break above/below the trend line, then identifies if the breakout is genuine or false.
    •	If no candle closes in the breakout zone, the trend remains intact.
    3.	Fibonacci Retracement Levels
    •	Kojo uses Fibonacci levels as confluences for entries:
    •	Only 50%, 61.8%, and 78.6% retracement levels are plotted.
    •	Entry is only considered if price retraces deeper than the 50% level.
    •	He focuses on ABC movements:
    •	A: Impulse.
    •	B: Correction (retracement).
    •	C: Second impulse.
    •	Take profit levels:
    •	First Take Profit: Previous peak (0% FIB level).
    •	Second Take Profit: Negative 27% FIB extension.
    4.	Patience and Precision
    •	Avoids trades in ranging markets or zones with unclear trends.
    •	Emphasizes waiting for candle closures as confirmation before executing trades.

    1.	Key Levels (Support/Resistance):
    •	Start with monthly zones for identifying high-probability trading ranges.
    2.	Trend Line Analysis:
    •	Look for third bounces on trend lines as potential trade setups.
    •	Combine false breakouts with trend direction for higher accuracy.
    3.	Fibonacci Confluence:
    •	Add FIB retracements to strengthen confluences.
    •	Focus on the 61.8% level (“Golden Level”) and negative 27% FIB extension for take profits.
